with description or any other attribute.
- Ans: 
- Ranking has direct correlation to the keyword used in search and presence of that keyword in either the app_id directly or in the app description.
- Early presence of keyword will impact the ranking as even with humans we see that people tend to look for catch words in the initial couple of sentences.
- APP ID has direct impact on the ranking as the search keyword, if present in the app_id itself, will impact in improving the ranking of the app in playstore.
- Another parameter that would affect the ranking is how many times an user who is looking out for a particular functionality chooses to press the app link. That is determined by the type of catchy adjectives used to explain about the in the short description. Like easy to use, free to use, etc.
- Short description will be more catchy if they are precise, than long descriptions
